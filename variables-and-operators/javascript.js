let name = "John";

// Add 2 numbers together
console.log(23 + 97)

// Add a sequence of 6 different numbers together
console.log(1 + 2 +  3 + 4 + 5 + 6)

// Print the value of the following expression: 
let nums = (4 + 6 + 9) / 77
console.log(nums)

//Let's use variables!

let a = 10

console.log(a)
9 * a
let b = 7 * a
console.log(b)

// Try this sequience:

let max = 57
let actual = max - 13
let percentage = actual / max
console.log(percentage)

// Name three ways to declare a variable
// let
// const 
// var

//Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
// var 
// it was the original way to define variables, however let and const allowed more control over assignment
//

//what happens when you add numbers and strings together?
//undefined, probably need a conversion like python

// How does the Modulo (%), or Remainder, operator work?
// Divides the numbers and gives you the leftover
//
// Explain the difference between == and ===.
// == equal value whereas === is equal value & equal type
//
// When would you receive a NaN result?
// NaN - Not a Number

// Nan is a javascript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number.

// Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in nan (not a number):
//
// How do you increment and decrement a number?
// ++ & --
//
// Explain the difference between prefixing and postfixing increment/decrement operators.
// prefixing returns the value with the increment included, postfixing returns the value before the increment/decrement is applied
//
// What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
// PEDMAS basically
//
// How do you access developer tools and the console?
// (Q) firefox, click console, inspect element on any browser though
//
// How do you log information to the console?
// console.log(information)
// or enter it into the console from the browser
//
// What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers? eg. +”10”
// nothing
